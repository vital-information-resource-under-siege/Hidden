# Breaking Down Barriers: Exploiting Authenticated IPC Clients

**Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** is a critical aspect of modern computing, enabling different processes within an operating system to exchange data and coordinate actions. Through various methods like message passing, shared memory, and sockets, IPC facilitates seamless interaction between distinct applications, enhancing system efficiency and functionality. However, the security of these communications is paramount, as vulnerabilities in authenticated IPC clients can lead to severe breaches and exploitation. 

So this was an idea thought about me and my teammates where our end goal was to make unauthenticated calls to a specific IPC client to perform privileged actions.

The targeted application uses dbus to send and receive IPC messages from
